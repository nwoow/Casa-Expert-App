In addition to the Charges paid to Service Professionals, CasaXprt may also charge you a convenience fee for handling the booking and transferring payments to the Service Professional (referred to as "Fees"). Your final bill may include extra charges like a safety fee, warranty fee, insurance fee, or Service Professional welfare fee.

                    Payment Processors: We may use a third-party payment processor ("Payment Processor") to handle your payments using your chosen payment method. The processing of payments will follow the terms and policies of the Payment Processor, along with our own Terms. CasaXprt is not responsible for any errors made by the Payment Processor. If a payment fails, any deducted money will be credited according to the Payment Processor's terms.
                    Cancellation: You can cancel your service request with a Service Professional at any time before their arrival. In such cases, you may incur a cancellation fee according to CasaXprt's cancellation policy. CasaXprt reserves the right to charge you or deduct applicable taxes for such cancellation fees.
                    Subscriptions: CasaXprt may offer subscription packages for a fee, providing additional benefits such as discounted Pro Services. These subscription packages will have their own terms and conditions, which you agree to by subscribing. These terms are an integral part of our overall agreement.
                    Gratuity Policy: CasaXprt does not allocate any part of your payment as a tip or gratuity for the Service Professional. Any statement suggesting tipping is "voluntary" or "not required" does not imply CasaXprt provides additional payments to Service Professionals. You're free to give a tip if you wish, but it's not obligatory. Tips are voluntary.
